## Why I choosed the following technologies

- Customer starter theme:

  I decided to build my own starter because I tried pre-built like Understrap but there were alot of extra files, that I did not need and this is mostly because it supports WooCommerce.

- ACF (Advanced Custom Fields):

  It is an excellent tool to allow the end-user to make edits, take advantage of taxonomies.

- Sass:

  An easy and simple way to keep all CSS in order.

- bxSlider:

  Using this tool to be able able to add a carousel typed element.

- Magnific Popup

  I found this library to be easy to use and lightweight for easy implementation of a lightbox element

- Modaal

  Accessibility is the main reason why I picked this plugin and only minimum CSS is necessary to customize.

- Laravel Mix

  This Webpack wrapper is included in my starter theme, but I picked it because it is a fast and easy way to automate the compiling process, and include auto-reload by default.
