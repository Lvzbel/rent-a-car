## Why I choosed the following technologies

UnderStrap:
After building a theme from scratch I decided to give a starter theme a try, UnderStrap seemed like a great option.

ACF:
I wanted to give the client the option to be able to edit the site easily.

## What I learned from this project

I learned to work with a starter theme, the experience was mixed. It was nice to not have to created every single page from scratch but at the same time, I had to make a lot of changes in order to make it work for me.

Understrap also has a lot of extra bulk I didn't need it because it also has WooCommerce compatibility, all this extra bulk did not really need for a simple site like this.

I think next time I will just develop my own starter theme to have full control over the project.
